# dacman

Small utility to generate [.dac files](http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tworld/tworld.html#8) for Tile World. Written to be a lighter, simpler alternative to Mike L's [DacGen](http://www.pillowpc2001.net/controls/dacgen.htm). Generates .dac files that ignore passwords for MS and Lynx for every .dat and .ccl file in your ./data directory.
